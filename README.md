# FlashR

This repo is meant as a staging ground to store native R functions that the OCP team uses,
which we hope to port to FlashGraph at some point soon.
The organization is as follows:

- model: sampling and estimating different random graph models
- embed: embed graphs using various techniques
- partition: partition graphs in myriad ways
- infer: estimate graphs from the kind of data we care about
- stats: compute test statistics to test different hypotheses
- unittest: test all the functions we wrote
